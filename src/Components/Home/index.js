              One of the main reasons behind todayâ€™s traffic problem are the techniques that are used for traffic management. 
              It has no emphasis on live traffic scenario, thus leading to inefficient traffic management systems. 
              These traffic timers just show the preset time.
            </p>
            <p>
              If the traffic light timers are showing correct time to regulate the traffic, 
              then the time wasted on unwanted green signals will be saved. Timer for every 
              lane is the simplest way to control traffic. And if those timers are predicting exact 
              time then automatically the system will be more efficient.
